## Roles

0. install casks
  - ...

0. dev-tools
  - iTerm2
  - Sublime (Adds a symlink to open files and folders with 'sublime' from the terminal)
  - VirtualBox
  - Vagrant

0. git

  This role installs git, sets the global config and adds some of alias to bash_profile. Set your email and name in *roles/git/defaults/main.yml*

- Ask for the password manager preference, instead of defaulting it to Dashlane
- Source bash_profile once created
- Setting up iTerm2 with my preferences
